    Here is some information about the President.
    <br>
    For the elections you need to make a speech. Make a good speech about what you would do when you become President. 
    To participate for the elections send a private message to the Head President. Then when you are accepted, 
    you can go to #elections on the discord server when there are elections. The first election will be on 9th March of 2019. 
    Every 3 months there will be elections. 
    <br>
    <br>
    When you have won the elections you can do everything what you want. But everything what you will do will be controlled by the
    Head President. If it's okay then you can do your thing.
